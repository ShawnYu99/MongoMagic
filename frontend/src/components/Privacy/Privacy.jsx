Sensitive information includes information about a person’s race, gender diversity, sexual orientation, disability, ethnic origin, political opinions, heath, religious or philosophical beliefs and criminal history. We will only collect and use sensitive information with your consent, in accordance with applicable laws or in a de-identified aggregated manner.
        </p>
        <p>
          You might need to provide personal information about other individuals to us (e.g. about your spouse, dependents or other family members). If so, we rely on you to have informed those individuals that you are giving their personal information to us and to have advised them about this Privacy Policy and how they can obtain a copy of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is important to be aware that if you access another party’s website or application using one of our products or services or via our website, that other party will deal with your personal information in accordance with its own Privacy Policy. You will need to review those websites to view a copy of the relevant Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is generally not practical to remain anonymous or to use a pseudonym when dealing with us as usually we need to use your personal information to provide specific services to you, or which relate to or involve you.
        </p>
        <PrivacyTittle>2. COLLECTING PERSONAL INFORMATION</PrivacyTittle>
        <p>
          Generally, we collect your personal information from you directly, for example, when we deal with you in person or over the phone, when you send us correspondence (including via email), when you complete a questionnaire, form or survey or when you subscribe to our publications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes we will collect your personal information from outside sources. These can include marketing mailing lists and other public information (including public posts to social networking sites such as Linkedin and Twitter) and commercially available personal, identity, geographic and demographic information. Outside sources may also include information gained from a third party. For example, we may collect your personal information from your employer where they are our client, your referees, your personal representatives, another G’TRACKER member firm, a financial advisor and/or banks where you have authorised disclosure to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may also collect personal information about you from your use of our websites and social media and information you provide to us through contact mailboxes.
        </p>
        <PrivacyTittle>3. HOLDING PERSONAL INFORMATION</PrivacyTittle>
        <p>
          We hold personal information in both hard copy and electronic formats. In some cases, we engage third parties to host electronic data (including data in relation to the services we provide) on our behalf. We take security measures to protect the personal information we hold which includes physical controls (for example, security passes to enter our offices and storage of files in lockable cabinets) as well as technological controls (for example, restriction of access, firewalls, the use of encryption, passwords and digital certificates).
        </p>
        <p>
          We also have policies and processes which govern document retention and data breach incidents. We endeavour to ensure that personal information is kept as current as possible and that irrelevant or excessive data is deleted or made anonymous as soon as reasonably practicable. However, some personal information may be retained for varying time periods in order to comply with legal and regulatory obligations and for other legitimate business reasons.
